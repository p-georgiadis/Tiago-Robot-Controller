*This report documents the implementation of a behavior tree-based autonomous controller for pick-and-place operations using the TIAGo robot in Webots simulation environment. All code and documentation are the original work of the author unless otherwise cited.*

## Solution Overview
This solution implements a behavior tree-controlled system for the TIAGo robot to autonomously locate, collect, and transport three jars from a kitchen counter to a designated table. The system combines computer vision, inverse kinematics, and reactive navigation to achieve reliable object manipulation in a dynamic environment.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Sensor Fusion System
- **Camera-to-World Coordinate Transformation**
  - Combines GPS, compass, and camera data for accurate object positioning
  - Applies height correction based on torso position
  - Handles perspective transformation

```python
    def camera_to_world_coordinates(camera_position, camera_offset=0.0):
        """Converts camera-relative coordinates to global world coordinates"""
        # Get robot's current position and orientation
        robot_pos = gps.getValues()
        compass_val = compass.getValues()
        robot_angle = np.arctan2(compass_val[0], compass_val[1])
        
        # Calculate precise camera height with torso lift
        camera_height = robot_pos[2] + 0.891 + torso_height
        
        # Apply height correction based on empirical observations
        z_correction = 0
        if torso_height > reference_torso_height:
            height_diff = torso_height - reference_torso_height
            z_correction = -1.87 * height_diff

            rho = np.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)  # Distance
            alpha = angle_difference(target_angle, theta)  # Heading error
            
            # Dynamic speed control based on distance
            # Proportional control for both linear and angular components
            vL = -self.p1 * alpha + self.p2 * rho  # Left wheel velocity
            vR = +self.p1 * alpha + self.p2 * rho  # Right wheel velocity

## Behavior Tree Code Explanation

### Initialization Phase
- `root`: The main sequence node that executes all children in order
- `initialization`: A sequence for hardware checks and initial positioning
- `check_hardware`: Verifies all required hardware components are working
- `move_to_safe_position`: Moves arm to predefined safe position
- `y_offsets`: Custom Y offsets for jars 1, 2, and 3 based on their position on the counter

### Task Sequences
For each jar (3 total), we create separate handling sequences:

#### Object Detection Phase
- `find_object`: A selector that tries different detection methods until one succeeds
- `recognize`: Uses camera to quickly recognize objects
- `comprehensive_scanner`: A more thorough but slower scanner that checks 8 directions with 45° increments

#### Approach Sequence
- `approach_sequence`: Positions robot properly before grasping
- `prepare_arm`: Moves arm to pre-approach position
- `move_arm_behavior`: Uses inverse kinematics with custom Y offsets for precise positioning
- `basic_move_to_object`: Navigates robot to jar using GPS, compass and camera
- `move_to_object`: Enhances navigation with LIDAR-based obstacle detection

#### Grasping and Transport Phase
- `grasp_behavior`: Controls gripper with force threshold for detecting successful grasp
- `transport_and_place`: Sequence for moving jar to table and placing it
- Transport steps: lift, backup, navigate to table, position for placement, release, reset arm, return home

## Observations and Analysis

### System Warnings

    WARNING: Possible oscillation in joint arm_1_joint
    WARNING: Possible oscillation in joint wheel_left_joint
    WARNING: Possible oscillation in joint wheel_right_joint

These warnings indicate minor control instabilities in certain joints, likely due to rapid direction changes or obstacle proximity. The system was able to continue operation despite these oscillations.

### Navigation Metrics
- Total distances traveled: 0.60m-1.12m per task sequence
- Displacement efficiency: 77.4%-100% (higher is better)
- Average navigation completion time: ~15-20 seconds per waypoint sequence
- Path efficiency monitoring logs:

```
    GPS Position: (0.958, -0.710, 0.093)
    Heading: -75.80° (-0.97, 0.25)
    Total distance traveled: 0.20m
    Displacement from start: 0.20m
    Path efficiency: 100.0%
```

<!-- IMAGE: Path visualization showing movement efficiency -->
![Path Efficiency Visualization](image-placeholder-15.jpg)
*Path efficiency visualization showing actual vs. optimal trajectory*

### Runtime Monitoring
The system includes a `RuntimeMonitor` class that tracks:
- Joint position histories
- Navigation trajectories 
- Sensor consistency
- Computational efficiency

This monitoring enables real-time performance analysis and early detection of potential issues, such as joint oscillations or inefficient paths.
